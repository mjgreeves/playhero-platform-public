# 🧠 PlayHero Platform — AI-Native Growth Operating System

**PlayHero** is an AI-powered growth operating system built for modern SaaS teams.  
It unifies GTM planning, website intelligence, and AI-generated hero sections into a single platform.

This public repo provides a high-level overview, architecture, screenshots, and product direction.  
The full production code lives in a private monorepo while the platform is in active development.

---

## 🚀 Overview

PlayHero brings together three connected AI applications:

### **PlayGTM**  
GTM planning intelligence, pipeline modeling, scenario planning, anomaly detection, and the Rallyboard execution canvas.

### **WebUX**  
AI website analyzer for UX clarity, CRO insights, competitor benchmarking, whitespace discovery, and messaging diagnostics.

### **SiteHero**  
An AI hero section generator for marketers, founders, and product-led teams — transforming prompt → image + copy + production-ready code.

All three apps share a unified design system (**DSv1**), multi-agent automation layer, and a common AI/Next.js infrastructure.
